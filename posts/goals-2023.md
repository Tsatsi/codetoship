## My goals for 2023.
### 1. Continue planning
This past year I started planning my days by listing 3 main things I want to accomplish the following day. I want to continue this practice and add a few more things to it. Weekly reviews to check how far from my desired goals I am. I also want to start planning my weeks and months. I want to be able to look back at the end of the year and see how far I have come.

### 2. Build and finish projects
Today I read an interesting tweet that said something around the lines of, only start a project if you are willing to make it great. I am going to take this to heart and only start projects that I am willing to finish. I want to build something that I can be proud of and that I can share with the world. I want to build something that will help people and that will make a difference. I want to build something that will make me proud. I will achieve this by only taking on projects that I am passionate about and that I am willing to put in the work to finish. For this reason I will limit the total number of projects I will take on this year to two.


### 3. Learn and grow
Continuous learning is important to me and I want to carry on with this. I want to be more deliberate with the documentation and sharing of the knowledge I gain. I want to be able to share my knowledge with others and help them grow.
