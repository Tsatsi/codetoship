## How to clearly define the user problem or need.
Software should solve a real problem or meet a genuine need of the target users. This is important because building software can get expensive. To reduce your chances of failure, you must understand the problem and the people you are building the solution for.

## Software requires a flexible and adaptable development process.
The software should be developed to allow updates, improvements, and changes as needed. This often means time upfront to set up these processes, but because it doesn’t result in immediate visible product results. Its importance can be mistakenly underestimated.

## It takes teamwork.
One developer can build a software product, but successful products often take a team to make. Whether it’s a team of two or more, having different perspectives can save a product from biases an individual may have.
